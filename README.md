# Chicago Crimes
### Background
(Hypothetical)
The City of Chicago's Police Department has been struggling with community support in recent years. Between high-profile officer-involved shootings nationwide and a perception that Chicago police are doing too little to curb the increase in gun violence in many neighborhoods, distrust of police may be worse than it's ever been. \[this part is probably real]
\[the rest is not real] The city has been looking into new ways to change the communities' perceptions of their police department. Through focus groups with community leaders, the City of Chicago learned that many civilians distrust the police because they are seen as "forces of destruction," even when they are sent in to help. Arrests can have a damaging impact on the offenders' families, and little is done to help the victims of the crimes when police are sent out. In order to combat negative perceptions of its police force, the City of Chicago has trained some of its police officers to act as "Community Support Officers": they act as police officers *and* social workers. Instead of focusing solely on the offenders, these officers are trained to assess the needs of the victims and the offenders' families and address them in whatever way they can. They are trained to offer brief emotional interventions and are aware of all the resources available from the City to help victims and families.
### Problem Statement
Because the Community Support Officer program is still in its infancy, the City of Chicago wants to focus on areas where they can make the most difference. In cases of domestic violence, the victim is typically *also* the offender's family. These situations are where the services of a Community Support Officer can be best utilized. Especially in cases where the perpetrator is the primary provider for the family, an arrest can wreak havoc on a family who was already just victimized. It's important that the victims feel supported, and there are many resources available to victims of domestic violence.
For this reason, Chicago Police wants to send out a team with a Community Support Officer when there is a domestic crime with a likely arrest. That is where my Data Science services has been requested. The City of Chicago would like for me to create an model that can predict whether a particular call to a domestic violence incident will lead to an arrest, so that a Community Support Officer can be prioritized to those situations.
